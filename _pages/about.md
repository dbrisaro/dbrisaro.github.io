Welcome to my personal website! I am Daniela Belén Risaro, a Climate Data Scientist with a PhD in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. My work focuses on climate risk assessment, environmental data analysis, and satellite imagery. Through innovative data-driven approaches, I contribute to advancing our understanding of climate variability and its impacts on ecosystems and society.

I have extensive experience working with geospatial datasets, applying machine learning techniques, and developing parametric models for climate risk insurance. My research spans a variety of topics, from sea surface temperature trends in South America to the development of open-source climate data for public policy.
